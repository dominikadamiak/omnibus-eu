# Omnibus for PrestaShop â€“ Free Module

The price history module for stores based on the PrestaShop platform has been created to meet the requirements of the Omnibus directive in force in the European Union.
Once installed, the Omnibus Directive module will record information on each product price change. In addition, our module supports products with combinations and support for multiple currencies. If you have more than one currency configured, then our module will save product prices for each currency available in your store. Based on this, the module provides the consumer with information about the lowest available price for the product.

The module has been tested in the following versions of PrestaShop:
-  1.7.8.10
-  8.0.5
-  8.1.2
